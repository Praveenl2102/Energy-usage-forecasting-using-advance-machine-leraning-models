# ⚡ Energy Usage Forecast Using Machine Learning Models

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on forecasting **energy consumption** using advanced **machine learning** and **deep learning** models.  
The goal is to predict short-term and long-term energy demand to help optimize energy distribution, reduce wastage, and support sustainable resource management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical energy usage data to identify trends and seasonal patterns.  
- Develop predictive models for accurate short-term and long-term energy consumption forecasting.  
- Compare the performance of traditional ML models with LSTM deep learning models.  
- Provide actionable insights for **energy efficiency** and **demand management**.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Collected time-series data of energy usage, temperature, and seasonal variables.  
   - Handled missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.  
   - Created new temporal features like hour, day, and month to capture cyclical patterns.  

2. **Model Development**
   - Implemented and compared multiple models:
     - Linear Regression  
     - Random Forest Regressor  
     - XGBoost  
     - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Network  

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated models using:
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
     - **R²-score**
   - Conducted **hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearchCV for better accuracy.

4. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Visualized actual vs. predicted energy usage trends using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**.  
   - Highlighted high-demand periods and provided recommendations for load balancing.
